# Hey, I'm Matt

I build desktop applications, automation tools, and browser extensions that solve real problems. By day, I deploy and support medical imaging systems (PACS) at healthcare facilities. By night, I write the tools I wish existed—file converters, text editors, system utilities, and scripts that make Windows actually behave.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **system administration**, **desktop development**, and **workflow automation**.

## What I Build

- **Desktop applications** with polished, professional interfaces—file converters, text editors, system utilities
- **PowerShell automation** for software deployment, network configuration, and remote support setup
- **Browser userscripts** that fix annoyances on YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, and other platforms
- **Medical imaging tools** including DICOM utilities and deployment automation for PACS environments
- **Windows system utilities** for firewall management, privacy hardening, and system administration
- **Video and media tools**—downloaders, subtitle removers, audio isolation, format converters
- **Build systems and installers** that package applications into clean, standalone executables

## How I Work

- **Complete solutions over fragments.** I ship full, working code—no placeholder comments, no "TODO: implement this later."
- **Self-contained by default.** Single-file solutions when practical, minimal external dependencies.
- **Professional polish matters.** Dark themes, consistent color schemes, interfaces that look like real software.
- **Automation over repetition.** If I do something twice, the third time is a script.
- **Documentation that's actually useful.** Clear READMEs, inline comments where they help, examples that work.

## Toolbox

**Languages:** PowerShell, Python, C#, JavaScript, Batch

**Desktop:** WinUI 3, WPF, WinForms

**Browser:** Userscripts (Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey), Chrome Extensions

**Platforms:** Windows, medical imaging systems (PACS, DICOM)

**Patterns:** CLI-first prototyping → GUI refinement, monolithic builds, automated packaging

## FAQ

**Why so many standalone tools instead of web apps?**
I solve problems where I find them. Most of my friction is on Windows, so that's where I build. Desktop apps also work offline and don't depend on someone else's server.

**Why monolithic over modular?**
For personal tools and utilities, a single self-contained file is easier to distribute, maintain, and understand. Modularity makes sense at scale, most of my projects aren't at that scale.

**Do you take requests or contributions?**
Open to both. File an issue or reach out directly.
