## About Me

<p align="center">Systems Admin • Desktop Dev • Workflow Automation</p>

- I build practical tools at the intersection of **system administration**, **desktop development**, and **workflow automation**
- I pay attention to recurring pain points, user complaints, and repetitive tasks, then turn them into solutions that make tech **simpler, faster, and more enjoyable**
- **20 years in tech**, starting in help desk and moving through systems administration, network engineering, broadcast engineering (TV), and consulting
- I’ve learned how non-technical users actually experience technology, how complex systems fail in the real world, and what it takes to earn end-user trust
- That experience shapes how I build: keep it clear, keep it simple, solve the real problem, and make the user’s job easier
- My rule: **start with what the user wants, then build the tech to match it**
- **SysAdminDoc** was the title of an internal documentation site I created over a decade ago, I kept the monikor
- Currently going all-in on AI, from Sora music experiments, Veo instructional videos, to nonstop prompt-engineering ideas
