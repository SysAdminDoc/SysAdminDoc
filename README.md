Most of my work sits between **system administration**, **desktop development**, and **workflow automation**.

---

## What I Build

- **Desktop apps** with clean, polished UI, converters, editors, system utilities
- **PowerShell automation** for deployments, config, and support setup
- **Browser userscripts/extensions** that smooth out annoying web UX
- **Medical imaging tooling** including DICOM helpers and PACS deployment automation
- **Windows utilities** for admin tasks like firewall and system configuration
- **Media tools** like downloaders and format converters
- **Packaged builds** that ship as simple, standalone executables

---

## How I Work

- Ship **complete, working solutions**, not fragments
- Prefer **self-contained** builds with minimal dependencies
- Care about **UX polish** (consistent design, dark themes)
- Automate repeat work fast
- Write docs that are **clear, practical, and readable**, with examples that actually run

---

## Toolbox

- **Languages:** PowerShell, Python, C#, JavaScript
- **Desktop:** WinUI 3, WPF, WinForms
- **Browser:** Userscripts, Chrome and Firefox extensions
- **Platforms:** Mostly Windows, plus cross-platform where it makes sense
- **Patterns:** CLI prototype → GUI refinement, single-binary packaging, turnkey installers

## FAQ

**Why desktop tools instead of web apps?**  
A lot of the problems I solve are Windows-first, offline-friendly, and not worth depending on a server.

**Why self-contained/monolithic tools?**  
For small utilities, one executable (or one script) is easier to ship, run, and support.
